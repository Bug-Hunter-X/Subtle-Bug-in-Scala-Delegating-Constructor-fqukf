```scala
class MyClass(val x: Int) {
  def this() = this(0) // Delegating constructor
  // ... other methods ...
}
```
This seemingly innocuous code can lead to subtle and hard-to-debug issues if `other methods` use `x` in a way that depends on its initialization.

**Problem:** The delegating constructor relies on the primary constructor's `x` parameter, which is initialized only after the constructor is called. In the meantime, `x` can have unexpected values, potentially throwing exceptions or leading to incorrect behavior if the methods accessing `x` are called before `this(0)` has finished executing.
